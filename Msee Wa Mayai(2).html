            Egg farming has been around for centuries,but commercial egg production began in the early 1900s. In the 1920s and 1930s, egg farms were still mostly backyard systems.<br> Many farmers had laying hens to supply their own families with eggs and would sell any extra eggs at local farmers’ markets.

        <h2>Raise your chicks</h2>
        <p3>Be sure when you choose your chicks, you're <a href="https://www.treehugger.com/a-chicken-breed-to-fit-your-need-4869051" target="_blank">picking a breed</a> that is very productive in the egg-laying department, and that also are hardy enough to survive in your climate. If you are in the north, you will want to consider supplementing with light in the winter, so that your hens produce eggs all year round.

            Raising laying hens on pasture can make for better eggs, and discerning customers now know the difference. <br> Deep, rich orange yolks bursting with flavor is what many now expect - and what you should easily get from hens with access to grubs, grasses, and the ability to roam over several acres to find the tastiest meals. On top of pasture, you'll want to provide high-quality feed and possibly additional calcium for strong shells.5
            
             You can also supplement with food and garden scraps

        <h2>Collect And Clean Eggs</h2>
        <p4>How you collect and clean eggs is extra important when you are selling them to others. <br>Make sure that you know how to properly clean your eggs so that you minimize the risk of salmonella poisoning.

        <h2>Diseases</h2>
        <p5> <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/poultry-farming" target="_blank">Poultry are quite susceptible</a> to a number of diseases. <br>Some of the more common are fowl typhoid, pullorum, fowl cholera, chronic respiratory disease, infectious sinusitis, infectious coryza, avian infectious hepatitis, infectious synovitis, bluecomb, Newcastle disease, fowl pox, avian leukosis complex, coccidiosis, blackhead, infectious laryngotracheitis, infectious bronchitis, and erysipelas. <br>Strict sanitary precautions, the intelligent use of antibiotics and vaccines, and the widespread use of cages for layers and confinement rearing for broilers have made it possible to effect satisfactory disease control.
        </p5>
        <p6>Outbreaks of bird flu, or avian influenza, which was first detected in humans in 1997, have led to the culling of millions of poultry animals since the late 20th century. Waterfowl such as wild ducks are thought to be primary hosts for all bird flu subtypes. Though normally resistant to the viruses, the birds carry them in their intestines and distribute them through feces into the environment, where they infect susceptible domestic birds. Sick birds pass the viruses to healthy birds through saliva, nasal secretions, and feces. <br>Within a single region, bird flu is transmitted readily from farm to farm by airborne feces-contaminated dust and soil, by contaminated clothing, feed, and equipment, or by wild animals carrying the virus on their bodies. The disease is spread from region to region by migratory birds and through international trade in live poultry. <br>Humans who are in close contact with sick birds—for example, poultry farmers and slaughterhouse workers—are at the greatest risk of becoming infected.

        <h2>Marketing of the eggs.</h2>
        <p7>The greater the distance between producer and consumer, the more complex is the marketing organization required to ensure that eggs reach consumers in the form, place and time desired. Producers may decide to market their produce directly to consumers - direct marketing - or may choose from a variety of marketing organizations that make up a marketing channel.

            Direct marketing includes the following methods of selling:
            <ul>
                <li>sales from the farm (farm gate);</li>
                <li>door-to-door sales;</li>
                <li>producers’ markets; and</li>
                <li>sales to local retail shops.</li>
            </ul>
           
            A typical marketing channel is made up of:
            <ul>
            <li>collectors;</li>
            <li>assembly merchants;</li>
            <li>wholesalers;</li>
            <li>retailers.</li>
            </ul>
        </p7>
